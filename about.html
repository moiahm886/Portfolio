<h1>My Story</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>I was born in Karachi in 2000, and from a young age, I had an innate love for problem-solving
    and a natural inclination towards mathematics. I excelled in numeracy and obtained high grades
    during my O-levels in the pre-engineering stream. Fuelled by my passion for math and physics,
    I pursued Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics for my A-levels.</p>
    <p>Eager to broaden my horizons and thirsting for knowledge, I ventured abroad to study at the
        Kaunas University of Science and Technology. Embarking on a bachelor's degree in aerospace
        engineering, I found myself in an alien country, surrounded by diverse cultures. This experience
        not only taught me the value of teamwork but also sharpened my communication skills and
        professionalism due to the highly professional European culture I encountered. Additionally,
        my travels to different countries enriched my understanding of global diversity and deepened
        my appreciation for different perspectives.</p>
    <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic compelled me to return to Pakistan, where I made a swift
        decision to switch gears and pursue a bachelor's degree in software engineering. Drawing on my
        affinity for mathematics, I delved into coding and acquired new skills in languages such as C++,
        Java, and competitive programming. Exploring various domains, including networking, artificial
        intelligence, and data science, I embraced a continuous learning mindset.</p>
    <p>My academic achievements and dedication were recognized through multiple accolades, including five
        Dean's Honor Awards during my bachelor's program. I actively participated in prestigious competitive
        programming events like the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) and VisioSpark at Comsats,
        where I showcased my problem-solving abilities and analytical prowess.</p>
    <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to equip myself with the skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing market.
        I am driven by an unwavering ambition to excel and stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
        With a diverse skill set and a thirst for continuous growth, I aspire to make a positive impact in the field
        of software engineering.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, my journey thus far is a testament to my unwavering passion for problem-solving, my love for
        mathematics and physics, and my resilience in the face of challenges. Through my educational experiences and
        exposure to diverse cultures, I have cultivated essential skills and developed a global perspective. I am
        determined to leverage my knowledge and expertise to contribute meaningfully to the field of software engineering
        and make a remarkable impact on the world around me.</p>
